# FlyingMonkey

This is an interpreter of the Monkey Language, written in Swift.

This project follows Thorsten Ball's book, [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com). I'm porting the Go code in the book to Swift as I go through the chapters of the book.

It currently implements the parser in the book up to section 2.6 - Parsing Expressions.
